Ni-W based alloys have been extensively employed in the nuclear energy and national defense industries due to their excellent static/dynamic mechanical properties and high densities. The mechanical performance of these alloys can be further tailored through the addition of a variety of impurities with varying compositions. To investigate the structure of this material and identify any potential precipitates and/or second phases, a 4D-STEM data set was acquired using a Gatan K3 IS camera and a STEMx system in electron counting mode on a JEOL ARM 300F. Data was binned 8x in diffraction space for faster analysis. This data was analyzed for the NUANCE/Gatan Virtual Workshop on 4D STEM: Theory, Acquisition, and Analysis on December 9th, 2020.
